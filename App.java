App.java
For use in the Final project for COSC 236.
Based on starter code first developed by Prof. Dastyni Loksa

This is the driver class of the project. It is in charge of the following:

- Setting up the game by creating the GameState.
- The main game loop deciding when the game quits.
- The input from the user and routing to the correct methods in the CommandSystem.
